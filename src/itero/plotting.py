"""
Visualisation utilities for polygon sequences.
 
This module provides Matplotlib-based rendering of PolygonSequence objects.
Each polygon in the sequence is drawn as a separate line, allowing the full
iterative transformation to be visualised as an overlapping series of shapes.

    Each polygon is drawn as a single continuous line using its x and y
    coordinate lists. Axes are hidden and aspect ratio is locked to equal
    so the shapes are not distorted.
 
    Args:
        polygons: The sequence of polygons to render. Typically the output
            of iterate_polygon.
        figure_size: Width and height of the figure in inches, passed
            directly to Matplotlib as (width, height).
        color: Line colour for all polygons. Accepts any value supported
            by Matplotlib (named colours, hex strings, RGB tuples, etc.).
        alpha: Opacity of each line, in the range [0.0, 1.0]. Lower values
            allow overlapping polygons to show through each other, which
            is often visually effective for large iteration counts.
        show: Whether to display the figure interactively. Set to False
            when rendering headlessly or only saving to disk. Defaults to True.
        save_path: File path to save the figure. The format is inferred
            from the extension (e.g. '.png', '.svg', '.pdf'). If None,
            the figure is not saved. Defaults to None.
 
    Example:
        >>> polygon = Polygon.regular(6)
        >>> sequence = iterate_polygon(polygon, t=0.1, iterations=200)
        >>> plot_polygons(sequence, figure_size=(8, 8), color='indigo', alpha=0.15)
